       <H3 style="font-family: cursive;"> 1. Zoos & Aquariums : </H3>
<p style="background-color: rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.498);">Many animals in tourism are living in Zoos and Aquariums. There is some argument that they are good for conservation purposes, helping to preserve threatened wildlife species. However, in reality, it’s hard to decide if the benefits outweigh the negatives. Some reasons to avoid visiting zoos or aquariums:</p><hr>

<p style="background-color: rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.712);">Wild animals shouldn’t be in captivity</p>
<p>In captivity, they are unable to lead a full and happy life. For example, dolphins should be able to deep-dive and swim across large expanses of ocean. In aquariums, dolphins are kept in small pools that don’t even come close to replicating their natural habitat.</p><hr>
       <P>
        It upsets their natural rhythm
Tigers and lions, for example, are normally active in the early morning or at night. As zoos are open all day, and people are always watching them, their natural biology has to change. This can be very stressful for them.</P><hr>
       <P>
        Animals are often forced to perform
To make animals perform in this way, the trainers often treat them cruelly. They may remove them at birth from their mothers, chain them, or use violence. If a zoo or aquarium offers an animal show, that’s a red flag.</P><hr>
       <P>
        Animals can get into a depression
Did you know that Tarsiers (found in the Philippines) commit suicide in captivity? Primates are very intelligent creatures and are at risk of boredom in environments outside of their wild habitat. This can cause them to have mental health problems, and even go as far as self-mutilation.</P><hr>
       <P>
        Alternatives to Wildlife Tourism for Zoos & Aquariums
Instead of visiting a zoo, consider visiting an ethical wildlife sanctuary instead. Make sure to do your research well, though, through a platform like the Global Federation of Wildlife Sanctuaries</P><hr>
       </P>
       <P>
        if you have a passion for sea creatures, consider volunteering for a charity like the Sea Turtle Conservancy in Costa Rica. Here they focus on researching, educating, and preserving sea life for the future. You could also participate in a beach clean-up and help make the oceans a safer place for aquatic life.<hr>

Another alternative is to go snorkeling or get your PADI diving certificate so you can see the life underwater. Great countries to get your PADI certificate are Thailand, Egypt, and Malta.<hr><br>
       </P>
       <P>
       <H3 style="font-family: cursive;"> 2. Wildlife Sanctuaries :</H3>
Although some wildlife sanctuaries are doing a lot of good, there are many that are unethical. Any wildlife sanctuary that offers tourists the opportunity to interact with animals should be avoided. Even if you hear or see words such as ‘roam freely’, ‘conservation’, or ‘wildlife protection’, this doesn’t necessarily mean that these sanctuaries are good. For example, some sanctuaries claim to save elephants from poaching but still allow tourists to ride them.</P><hr><br>
       </P>
       <P>
      <H3 style="font-family: cursive;">3.  Tiger Selfies :</H3>
You may have seen or heard of tiger selfies in Asia. This is an activity for travelers who want to fulfill their dreams of getting up close with these majestic creatures. In reality, it’s not possible for a wild animal to calmly interact with humans and the sanctuaries drug them to do so.</P><hr>

Thailand, in particular, is a popular spot for this kind of wildlife tourism. Many of the tigers are separated from their mothers from birth, confined in small cages, chained, drugged, and made to suffer extreme stress throughout their lives. Infamous wildlife sanctuaries, like the Tiger Kingdom, were even found to be selling tiger skin and body parts. Here’s an article by Vox about this shady business.</p><hr><br>

       <H3 style="font-family:cursive ;"> 4. Alternatives to Wildlife Sanctuaries :</H3>
Although it’s hard to find wildlife sanctuaries that are ethical, there are certain databases you can check—for example, the Global Federation of Sanctuaries. Make sure the sanctuary you’re visiting works in conservation, is reputable, and doesn’t allow any photos or touching of the animals.Alternatively, choose an experience in the wild, such as a canoe trip down the Amazon River. During these experiences, you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of some beautiful exotic animals</P><hr><br>

     <H3 style="font-family: cursive;">5. Wildlife Experiences :</H3>
It’s very common to see wildlife experiences on offer for tourists. This can range from walking with lions to feeding crocodiles or diving with sharks. All of these experiences can cause a variety of problems: upsetting the ecosystem, causing poor relationships between animals and humans, and putting undue stress on wildlife and the planet</P><hr>
